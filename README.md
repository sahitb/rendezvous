This was our fall 2015 MHacks 6 project. The team members who contributed to this project were Roberty Levy, Sahit Bollineni, Chien Min Soh, Preetom Chakraborty, and Mohammed Jahangir.

The purpose of this program is to find the cheapest location for you and your friends to fly to if you wanted to meet up. In addition, it shows you which of your friend's hometowns is the cheapest for everyone to visit.

The flight data was provided by the Expedia API. The website was built using JavaScript, HTML5, CSS3, and Bootstrap 3.
